# Needleman-Wunsch's Algorithm Implementation
<h3>This project implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, a dynamic programming technique used for global sequence alignment. The algorithm takes two DNA sequences as input and computes the optimal global alignment, considering match, mismatch, and gap penalties. This implementation returns the aligned sequences and the final alignment score.</h3>
